# when-im-bored
Simple Chrome extension to randomly choose a site to visit, WHEN IM BORED.

Apparently making Chrome extensions is [really accessible](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted "Getting started")? You need to enable developer mode in Chrome, but then you just go to [extensions](chrome://extensions/ "Extensions"), click "Load unpacked extension..." and find the directory where your extension is located. Crazy!
